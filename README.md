# Vibe coded network validator

This thing was generated with AI. It creates a central server with a simple UI to which a bunch of servers register, and send their network config. You can then click a button to trigger all nodes to ping eachother on addresses in the same class they have configured locally. This is to test that all nics have connectivity to all other hosts in the same LAN in setups where a bunch of servers were deployed via PXE.
